Why foreigners might shy away from reading English books.
We have this assumption that we must know the meanings of all the words to read and understand books and if we don't the meanings of certain words, we can't fully understand the concept or story. Well, it helps if you have a wide vocabulary and prior reading experience but this is not a neccessity for reading a book, however hard it is. I've gained some insights which could help new readers.
1. Learn to identify the names of people, places, streets, foods, etc. 
You should never look up these words. You should skip over weirdly spelt names, places, foods, etc. which are not really relevant to the story. Whenever you encounter a foreign sounding place name, just read it as a place and move on. You don't have to know or remember the place. Just know what it spells like and recognize if it comes up later. This applies to other names as well. 
For ex: "Globe-trotting gold dealer Roy Sebag has described the differences between Asian and Western views of jewelry."

Here, "Globe-trotting gold dealer Roy Sebag" is a noun-phrase and is just a description of the person (Roy Sebag). You can completely skip over it. It's not much important to know the meaning of "Globe-trotting". And identify Rob Sebag is a person's name. Now you know you don't have to look up the meaning of these words.

So it all comes down to this: 
"Someone has described the differences between Asian and Western views of jewelry."

Don't look up the meanings of difficult words while reading. It would only interrupt your flow.
Instead, try to guess the meaning from the context, from the circumstantial parts.
